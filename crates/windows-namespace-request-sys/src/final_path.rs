// Copyright (c) Mike Grier.

//! The `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` entry.
//!
//! Entry 7 of the audited catalogue, and the one with the **strongest offload
//! evidence**. Globazog reaches it through `std::fs::canonicalize`, which it
//! performs on its *submitting* thread once per root -- a full `CreateFileW`
//! plus this call plus `CloseHandle`, with unbounded latency on a network path
//! -- and repeats per reparse-point candidate on a worker. It is first-class
//! here, not second-tier.
//!
//! # The call reports a length, and the caller grows the buffer
//!
//! Unlike [`crate::query`], this call *does* report a length -- but with a
//! twist that is easy to get wrong. On success it returns the number of
//! characters written, **excluding** the terminating NUL. When the buffer is
//! too small it returns the size required **including** the NUL, and does not
//! set a failure code the caller would recognise as "try again bigger". The
//! two returns are distinguished by comparing against the buffer size, and this
//! entry does that retry itself rather than handing a caller a raw length it
//! must interpret.
//!
//! The retry is bounded. A path cannot grow without limit between attempts, so
//! an unbounded loop could only spin on a pathological or hostile filesystem;
//! [`FinalPathError::Unstable`] reports that rather than hanging a worker.
