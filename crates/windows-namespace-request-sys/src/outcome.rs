// Copyright (c) Mike Grier.

//! The faithful-execution contract every entry follows.
//!
//! An entry reports what Windows reported. It does not normalise a code, map it
//! onto a friendlier taxonomy, or decide that one failure "really means"
//! something else.
//!
//! # Why preservation is a constraint, not a preference
//!
//! `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` means three different things depending on which call
//! produced it and when: a missing directory from an open, an **empty**
//! directory from a first query, and a genuine failure from a later one. Only a
//! consumer holding that context can tell them apart. Any reclassification here
//! destroys information no layer above can reconstruct.
//!
//! # Why the code is snapshotted rather than read later
//!
//! `GetLastError` is thread state, and it is *volatile* thread state: almost
//! any subsequent Win32 call overwrites it, including cleanup a caller does not
//! think of as a call at all -- a `CloseHandle` in a `Drop`, a buffer being
//! released, a restoration guard unwinding. Reading it a few statements after
//! the failure is a race against the entry's own tidying up.
//!
//! So the read is not left to the caller's discipline. [`perform`] and its
//! convention-specific forms take the call as a closure and snapshot the code
//! **in the statement after it returns**, before anything else can run. Binding
//! to these functions is what makes the guarantee structural rather than a rule
//! each entry has to remember.
//!
//! # Scope: entries, not capture
//!
//! This governs the Win32 call an entry *performs*. It does not govern capture
//! failures -- [`crate::handle`], [`crate::security`], and [`crate::path`]
//! report a named stage plus a code, because there the useful question is which
//! part of building the request went wrong. Those happen on the calling thread,
//! before any entry runs.
