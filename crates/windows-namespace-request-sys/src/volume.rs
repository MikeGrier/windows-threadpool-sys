//! The `GetVolumeInformationByHandleW` entry.
//!
//! Entry 8 of the audited catalogue: the **handle-based** volume query.
//!
//! # Why the path-based call is not here
//!
//! `GetVolumeInformationW` takes a root path rather than a handle and is a
//! different Win32 call, so it would be its own entry. No audited consumer
//! calls it, so it is deliberately out of round one -- recorded so a later
//! reader can tell a considered omission from an unexamined one.
//!
//! # Two buffers, one call
//!
//! The call fills a volume-label buffer and a filesystem-name buffer in the
//! same invocation, alongside three scalar out-parameters. Both buffers have
//! documented maximums, so unlike [`crate::final_path`] this entry needs no
//! grow-and-retry: it allocates the maximum once and is done.
