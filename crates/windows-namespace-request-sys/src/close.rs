//! The close entries.
//!
//! Entry 4 of the audited catalogue, and the one whose membership surprises
//! people.
//!
//! # Why closing is a catalogue entry at all
//!
//! `CloseHandle` looks like bookkeeping, but it is a blocking namespace call.
//! It waits for outstanding I/O on the handle to complete, and on a dead
//! network path or an ejected removable device it can block hard -- which is
//! the whole reason this facility exists. A consumer that carefully moved its
//! opens onto a worker and then closed on its own thread would have moved the
//! wrong half.
//!
//! # A handle carries its close routine
//!
//! The audit found that a close entry **cannot assume its routine**:
//! `FindCloseChangeNotification` closes an
//! [`crate::watch::ChangeNotification`] and `CloseHandle` is wrong for it,
//! silently. So the routine travels with the handle rather than being chosen at
//! the call site, which is the same shape
//! [windows-threadpool-sys](https://docs.rs/windows-threadpool-sys) already
//! needed for wait targets.
//!
//! # A request is consumed by performing it
//!
//! [`CloseRequest::perform`] takes `self`, so a handle cannot be closed twice
//! through this type. An unperformed request still closes its handle when
//! dropped, because the alternative is a leak: a request that quietly did
//! nothing would be worse than one that closes late.
