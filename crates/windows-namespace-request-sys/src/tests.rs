//! The property that binds the foundations together.
//!
//! Each foundation already proves its own independence in its own module: a
//! duplicated handle outlives its source, a captured descriptor outlives the
//! absolute one it was built from, a prepared path outlives the string it came
//! from. What only a test at this level can show is the **composite** -- one
//! value holding all three, outliving *every* input at once and still working
//! on a thread that never saw any of them.
//!
//! That is the property an entry will depend on, so it is asserted here rather
//! than inferred from three separate results.
