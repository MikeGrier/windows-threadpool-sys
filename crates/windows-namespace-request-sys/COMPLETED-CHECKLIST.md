## Moved 2026-09-10 -- NR-1: the per-drive current-directory arm, pinned

### <a id="nr-11"></a>NR-1.1 -- Pin the `=X:` arm of drive-relative rooting. *(completed 2026-09-10 12:24:46 UTC-04:00)*

- [x] **NR-1.1** -- Decide how this crate's tests may control process-global
  state, then pin the `=X:` arm of drive-relative rooting.

  **Completed in the round that raised it, because the blocker turned out not to
  exist.** The item was written to defer the work: pinning the arm needs a
  controlled `=X:`, and the two routes to one -- mutating process-global state
  that other test threads share, or spawning a child process with a crafted
  environment -- looked like a decision about this crate's test shape rather than
  something to take in passing.

  Measurement dissolved the first route's objection within the hour.
  `GetFullPathNameW` **itself** writes the `=X:` entry -- when resolving for a
  drive other than the current one, and when the recorded entry is absent or
  rejected, in which case it is written as the drive root. (An accepted entry is
  left alone, and the current-drive form touches nothing.) The code under test
  therefore already mutates that state on the very path these tests exercise, so
  a test that sets it first introduces no hazard that resolving alone did not,
  and there was nothing left to decide. Isolation across the tests comes from
  their disjoint drive letters.

  `a_drive_relative_path_uses_that_drives_entry_verbatim_and_rewrites_a_bad_one`
  in [tests.rs](src/full_path/tests.rs) now pins all three behaviours: an entry
  naming an existing directory is honoured verbatim (onto a *different* drive,
  which is what makes "that drive's own current directory" a convention rather
  than a guarantee); an entry naming nothing is rejected in favour of the drive
  root; and the call writes the entry back, creating it on a host that had none.
  It draws from the disjoint `W`/`U` pair -- taking `U` when the current drive or
the probe directory's drive is `W` -- so it cannot race the sibling tests'
`X`/`Y`, `V`/`T` or `R`/`S` under libtest's
  thread-per-test model.

  The sibling test
  `a_drive_relative_path_is_rooted_at_that_drive_and_not_the_process_directory`
  keeps its weaker form and now says so: without controlling the entry it can
  only bound the arm.
