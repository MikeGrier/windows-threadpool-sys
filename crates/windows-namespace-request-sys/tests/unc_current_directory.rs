//! Root-relative rooting under a UNC current directory.
//!
//! An integration test, and a two-process one, because the property is not
//! expressible any other way. The current directory is **process-wide**, so a
//! test that wants to observe what `GetFullPathNameW` does under a UNC one has
//! to *be* a process that has a UNC one -- and it must not impose that on the
//! rest of the suite, which runs as threads in the same process.
//!
//! What it pins is the branch the module doc calls out and nothing else
//! reached: a root-relative path (`\foo`) is rooted at the **root of the
//! current directory**, which under a UNC current directory is the share root
//! `\\server\share\` and not a drive. The unit test for the same rule runs
//! under whatever directory launched the suite, so on ordinary drive-rooted CI
//! it only ever exercises the `C:\foo` half; it computes the UNC expectation
//! but never puts the call in a position to produce one.
//!
//! The child is this same test binary, re-executed with a marker in its
//! environment and a filter naming the one test to run. That keeps the
//! assertion beside the thing it asserts rather than in a fixture binary whose
//! drift nothing would catch.

// The alternative -- skipping quietly when the share is missing -- is the one
// thing that must not happen, because this is the ONLY coverage of the UNC
