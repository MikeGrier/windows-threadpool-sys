//! Scenario coverage: does the catalogue serve each consumer's actual *shape*?
//!
//! A different question from "is every call reachable", and the one the
//! original audit left unanswered. Globazog makes it concrete and demanding:
//! one capture taken at submission, shared by up to 64 concurrent workers,
//! applied repeatedly over a traversal that may run for minutes.
//!
//! # This is where the two sibling crates are paired
//!
//! `windows-thread-ambient-sys` is a **dev**-dependency of this crate and
//! nothing more. That is the whole point: a request carries no ambient context
//! and a context is useful to work that never opens a file, so whoever owns
//! both pairs them at the submission site. These tests *are* that submission
//! site, which is the only honest way to demonstrate a relationship the design
//! deliberately refuses to make into a dependency.
