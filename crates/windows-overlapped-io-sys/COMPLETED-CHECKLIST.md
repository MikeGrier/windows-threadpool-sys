# Completed checklist: windows-overlapped-io-sys

Append-only record of completed checklist groups. Design decisions are in
[DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md).

## Moved 2026-08-16 — Overlapped-I/O foundation (milestones M1–M4)

### M1 — Design and contracts

- [x] Specify the rounded-out overlapped-I/O requirements and the crate boundary.
- [x] Specify the voluntary-rundown-versus-`Drop` contract.

### M2 — Ownership and operation storage

- [x] Implement endpoint ownership and the unsafe provenance seam.
- [x] Implement pinned operation storage and `OVERLAPPED` completion identity.

### M3 — Raw IOCP backend

- [x] Implement the raw IOCP backend: port, association, submission, and cancellation.
- [x] Implement outstanding-operation accounting, generic reclamation, and blocking rundown for the voluntary
	method and `Drop`, with a non-panicking `Drop` diagnostic that names each outstanding operation's submit
	site (the `operation-backtrace` feature adds full backtraces).

### M4 — Blocking backend and submission seam

- [x] Implement and test the blocking `GetOverlappedResult` backend for un-ported endpoints.
- [x] Define the submission seam (`into_overlapped` / `from_overlapped` / `reclaim_overlapped`) consumed by the
	thread-pool `TP_IO` implementation, and dogfood it in the raw IOCP backend.
