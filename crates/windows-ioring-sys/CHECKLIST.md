# Checklist: windows-ioring-sys

Design decisions are in [DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md); the session that produced them is
[DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-22-ioring-architecture.md](design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-22-ioring-architecture.md).
M1 through M7 (ring lifecycle through the `ring-copy` sample) are archived in
[COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md](COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md#moved-2026-08-22----m1-through-m6-ring-lifecycle-through-consumer-documentation)
and
[COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md](COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md#moved-2026-08-23----m7-ring-copy-a-topology-aligned-sample).

## M6+ -- Model B: explicit-thread delivery and affinity

Parked, not pending. Deferred by the engineer's explicit direction during the 2026-08-22 design session,
with the plan scoped now so the shape is not lost. This is **not** a fallback for a missing capability
(D-3) -- it is the high-performance architecture, and M4's thread-pool path is the convenient one.

- [ ] **M6+.1** -- `DeliveryMode::{ThreadpoolWait, PinnedThread}` as an explicit consumer choice, never an
  automatic degradation.

- [ ] **M6+.2** -- Resolve the contention between a thread parked in `SubmitIoRing(ring, n, INFINITE, ..)`
  and callers wanting to build SQEs. This is the hard part and the reason this is its own milestone: it
  directly contradicts M3.1's `&mut`-enforced serialization, and needs either a submit-ownership handoff
  or an internal lock. Neither is obviously right.

- [ ] **M6+.3** -- Shutdown: waking a thread parked on `INFINITE`. `IORING_OP_NOP` is supported and is the
  wake mechanism.

- [ ] **M6+.4** -- Affinity: binding a ring's thread with `SetThreadGroupAffinity`, and documenting the
  execution-domain pattern (one pinned thread, its ring, its node-local registered pool, its shard).

- [ ] **M6+.5** -- A test seam forcing the pinned-thread path even where the completion event is available,
  so it stays testable on every machine rather than only on hardware that lacks the feature.

- [ ] **M6+.6** -- Decide `IoBuf`: extract to a shared crate, re-export from
  `windows-overlapped-io-sys`, or leave duplicated (D-1). The merge-or-delete decision that duplicate-then-decide
  defers to the point where the new path is proven -- which is here, not earlier.
