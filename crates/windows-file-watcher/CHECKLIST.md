# Checklist: windows-file-watcher

Memory-safe Windows path-change watcher. The design session that opened the crate recorded D-1...D-20 in
[design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-18-windows-file-watcher.md](design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-18-windows-file-watcher.md).
The authoritative Tier-1 set is [DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md), which now runs to **D-76** -- later
decisions (D-21 from M1 review, D-22...D-26 and D-34/D-35 from M2, D-36...D-49 from M3, D-50...D-52 from M4,
D-53...D-59 from M5, D-60...D-65 from M6, D-32 from M8.1, D-66...D-76 from M9.1...M9+.4, and D-25/D-27...D-31
plus D-33 from the [2026-08-21 fault-protocol session](design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-21-fault-protocol-and-doorbells.md),
which **overturned D-16**) are added there as milestones complete.

Work items are dependency-ordered. Each milestone ends with integration tests. The implicit
end-of-milestone gate (default **and** `--all-features` build/test/clippy/doc clean, encoding check, sync
with origin) is standard procedure and is not listed as an item.

Completed milestones are archived in [COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md](COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md).

> **NEXT ACTIONABLE ITEM: none.** M1 through M9+ are archived/done. Only the parked, ungated M-inf
> horizon items remain, and none is an open obligation of any current milestone.

## M4 -- Coalescing by directory and file targets

Archived in [COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md](COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md#moved-2026-08-21----m4-coalescing-by-directory-and-file-targets).

## M-inf -- Horizon (ungated, post-v1)

Parked, not pending. These are the deferred seams recorded in [DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md) -> D-19,
an explicit design decision that places them outside the v1 scope. That recorded decision -- not the
absence of a current consumer -- is why each is deferred, which is a legitimate deferral rationale (a
resolved, recorded scope decision), not a scope-boundary excuse. Each graduates to a numbered milestone
when a post-v1 line of work takes one up. None is an open obligation of any current milestone.

- [ ] **M-inf.1** -- `ReadDirectoryChangesExW` extended records (`FILE_NOTIFY_EXTENDED_INFORMATION`): surface the
  richer per-record fields on OS versions that support it, behind capability detection, without disturbing
  the basic `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION` surface (D-18/D-19). **Availability is per-filesystem, not merely
  per-OS-version:** even on a build that exposes the API, some filesystems reject the extended structure --
  e.g. ReFS still does not support it (for no good reason) -- so detection must probe the actual target
  volume and fall back to `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION`, never inferring support from the OS version alone.

- [ ] **M-inf.2** -- Digest-based change *verification*: an optional mode that confirms a reported change by
  hashing content, trading cost for fewer spurious notifications (D-19).

- [ ] **M-inf.3** -- Per-volume capability cache: remember detailed-vs-coarse (and extended-record) support per
  volume so establish/re-establish need not re-probe each time (D-17/D-19).
