# Completed checklist: workspace

Append-only record of completed workspace-level checklist groups.

## Moved 2026-08-16 — Workspace and release (M1)

- [x] Specialize the crate name, metadata, documentation, and release config.

- [x] Split the workspace into `windows-overlapped-io-sys` and `windows-threadpool-sys` with independent,
	component-tagged publishing.

- [x] Reserve the `windows-overlapped-io-sys` name on crates.io — published `windows-overlapped-io-sys` and
	`windows-threadpool-sys` v0.1.0 to reserve both names.

- [x] Confirm CI and crates.io publishing secrets are configured for both crates.

## Moved 2026-08-16 — Shared invariants (M2)

- [x] Select the initial `windows-sys` feature set and document the FFI boundary.

- [x] Choose the minimum supported Windows version for the pair (Windows Server 2025 / Windows 11, per CI).

- [x] Specify the ownership, cancellation, and callback lifetime invariants shared by both crates — see the
	"Shared invariants (both crates)" section in [DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md).
