# Checklist: workspace

Workspace-level and cross-crate work. Per-crate checklists are listed in
[PLANS.md](PLANS.md); completed groups are archived in
[COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md](COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md). The authoritative cross-component
decisions are in [DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md) and their rationale is in
[DESIGN-RATIONALE.md](DESIGN-RATIONALE.md). The originating discussion for the
M1-M7 work archived below is in
[design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-27-async-file-enumeration.md](design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-27-async-file-enumeration.md).

The decisions the pending items below implement are in
[DESIGN-NOTES.md](DESIGN-NOTES.md#remoting-synchronous-namespace-operations); the session that produced
them, with the full measurement transcripts and the rejected alternatives, is
[design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-27-pseudo-async-namespace-operations.md](design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-2026-08-27-pseudo-async-namespace-operations.md).

## M19 -- Propagate the 2026-08-27 platform measurements

The design session measured nine platform behaviours, several of which contradict what shipped code
currently assumes or what shipped documentation currently says. These items propagate those findings;
they are deliberately separate from building the new facility, which cannot start until they land.

- [ ] **M19.1** -- Discharge `windows-ioring-sys` D-14's unverified registration-index continuity, which
  [its M10.3](crates/windows-ioring-sys/CHECKLIST.md) records as needing either measurement or a plain
  statement that continuity is not guaranteed. It is now measured: a second
  `BuildIoRingRegisterFileHandles` **replaces** the whole table, re-basing indices at zero (a read of index
  0 returned the second batch's first file, and the old count's index reported `ERROR_INVALID_INDEX`);
  capacity reached 65536 handles; and an in-flight read against an old index completed with its full byte
  count after the table was replaced beneath it, so **indices are resolved at submission**. Rewrite D-14
  from an assumption into a measured statement, and record the replace semantics on the public API.

- [ ] **M19.2** -- Relax `Batch::register_files`'s one-registration-per-ring rule, which is now measurably
  stronger than the hazard requires. It refuses a second registration outright to prevent silently
  invalidating handed-out `RegisteredFile` indices; M19.1 shows repeated registration is supported and does
  not disturb in-flight operations. Carry a table generation on the ring and on every `RegisteredFile`,
  validate it where `RingId` is already validated, and permit re-registration. Keeps the safety property
  while removing a restriction that would make a long-lived domain unable to add files. Depends on M19.1.

- [ ] **M19.3** -- State the completion-port/`IoRing` fork on both crates' public surfaces. Associating a
  handle with a completion port -- including via `CreateThreadpoolIo` -- permanently prevents `IoRing` use
  of that handle (`ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`), while leaving it fully usable through the port. Document it
  on `UnassociatedEndpoint`'s association transition, on `ThreadpoolIo::new`, and on `Batch`'s file-taking
  pushes, including the derived trap: a ring-destined handle is not port-associated, so an ordinary
  overlapped operation issued on it from a transient worker is thread-bound and dies with that worker.

- [ ] **M19.4** -- Correct the thread-pool growth documentation, which currently describes
  `set_runs_long` as an accounting hint. Measured, it is the difference between reaching 16 concurrent
  blocked callbacks in 1.94 s and in 1 ms: four threads are created immediately and growth beyond that is
  throttled to roughly one thread per 166 ms without it. Also record the measured default maximum of 512,
  which `set_max_threads`' documentation deliberately declines to guess at, and note that both the free
  count and the injection interval are likely processor-count-dependent and were measured only on ARM64.

- [ ] **M19.5** -- Re-measure M19.4's two numeric findings on x64 and record whichever of them is
  architecture-dependent. The semantic results from the session (the fork, thread agnosticism, token
  inheritance, device-map behaviour, `CancelSynchronousIo`'s blocking rule) do not need this; the free
  thread count, the 166 ms injection interval, and the 512 default do. Depends on M19.4.

## M20 -- Decide the session-independent path form

- [ ] **M20.1** -- Decide what the namespace facility does with a session-relative drive letter, and record
  it as a decision rather than leaving the absence of one implicit. Path resolution follows the
  impersonated token's logon session (measured: under a token from another logon session with unchanged
  local access, the global `C:` resolved and a `subst` letter did not), and `GetFullPathNameW` is lexical
  so submission-time canonicalisation does not expand the letter. `QueryDosDeviceW` distinguishes a real
  local volume, a `subst`, and a network mapping cheaply, so detection is settled and only the response is
  open: expand to a session-independent form at submission, or reject at admission with a typed error.
  Expansion is not uniform -- a network mapping becomes a UNC path, a local volume becomes a device path
  needing `\\?\GLOBALROOT\`, and a `subst` becomes another path entirely -- which is the reason this is a
  decision rather than an implementation detail.

## M21 -- Reconcile with the shipped namespace-plane work

PR #44 landed `windows-impersonation-token-sys` and `windows-file-enumeration-sys` while this design
session was in progress. Both are inhabitants of the plane the session scoped, so the relationship has to
be settled rather than discovered later.

- [ ] **M21.1** -- Sweep the workspace design notes for prose that says the impersonation and enumeration
  crates *will be* added, now that both have shipped. The "Captured impersonation is a separate platform
  layer" section still opens "The workspace will add ...". This is the blast-radius half of a correction:
  the fact changed, and the statements of it have to be swept rather than the one site a reader happened
  to notice.

- [ ] **M21.2** -- Settle the two open sub-questions in the context decomposition: whether the caller's
  thread error mode is captured at all (for diagnostics) or not captured as dead weight, given that the
  facility overrides rather than transplants it; and whether the non-dialog error-mode bits
  (`SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT`, `SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX`) are transplantable while the dialog-suppressing
  bits stay forced. Note `SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT`'s behaviour is architecture-dependent, so this needs
  measurement on both ARM64 and x64 rather than reasoning.

- [ ] **M21.3** -- Replace `windows-file-enumeration-sys`'s inline `open_directory` with the general
  facility's catalogue operation. The direction is settled, not open: that open is the committed first
  consumer, and the inline path exists only until the general one is proven. The replacement must preserve
  everything the shipped open already gets right, each of which is a constraint on the catalogue rather
  than an implementation detail: arbitrary access, share mode and flags (it opens with
  `FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY`, not `GENERIC_READ`, and requires `FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS` to obtain a
  directory handle at all); an **unassociated** handle, since `GetFileInformationByHandleEx` is
  synchronous; the raw Win32 code unaltered, because `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` means three different things
  across the open and the first and later queries and only the consumer can disambiguate; and
  `GetLastError` captured *before* the context is restored, which the shipped code does deliberately.
  Its D-15 Globazog acceptance gate must still pass afterwards.

- [ ] **M21.4** -- Add the `FileBasicInfo` query as its own catalogue entry, and have the enumeration
  crate sequence it after the open rather than performing it inline. It is a blocking namespace call, so
  leaving it inline would keep a blocking call on the consumer's worker and only half-solve the problem
  this facility exists for. One entry per Win32 call: this is **not** a compound open-and-classify
  operation, and the sequencing is logical and client-side -- the crate submits the open, observes its
  completion, then submits the query. A compound entry is reserved for a measured performance argument
  and would be a fusion of these two entries rather than a capability they lack. Depends on M21.3.

## M34 -- Tooling

Numbered M34 rather than M22 because the three root-level checklists share one milestone space:
[CHECKLIST.md](CHECKLIST.md) holds M19-M21, [CHECKLIST-thread-ambient.md](CHECKLIST-thread-ambient.md)
M22-M29, and [CHECKLIST-io-domains.md](CHECKLIST-io-domains.md) M30-M33.

- [x] **M34.1** -- Promote the ad-hoc sabotage harness into a reusable tool. -> [completed 2026-08-31](COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md#m341)

- [ ] **M34.2** -- **Route every tool's output through one sink, per the repository's own rule**: never
  call `println!`/`eprintln!` from more than one site in a tool; introduce a writer trait, sink or
  formatter at the first occurrence and route everything through it. Seven binaries violate this today
  and were flagged individually in review 5072622803 on pull request #56:
  [placement_probe.rs](crates/windows-placement-probe/src/bin/placement_probe.rs),
  [doorbell_cost.rs](crates/windows-platform-probes/src/bin/doorbell_cost.rs),
  [queue_contention.rs](crates/windows-platform-probes/src/bin/queue_contention.rs),
  [request_cost.rs](crates/windows-platform-probes/src/bin/request_cost.rs),
  [topology.rs](crates/windows-platform-probes/src/bin/topology.rs),
  [core_affinity.rs](crates/windows-platform-probes/src/bin/core_affinity.rs) and
  [peer_index_cache.rs](crates/windows-platform-probes/src/bin/peer_index_cache.rs). The banner
  helpers that hardcode stdout are part of it, not an exception to it.
  **Deferred from that pull request deliberately, and the reason is sequencing rather than doubt.** It
  is one refactor across seven binaries; done properly it means choosing the seam once and applying it
  uniformly, which is a large diff touching every probe's output. Landing it inside a 90-commit branch
  already under review would mix it with unrelated correctness work.
  **The point of the rule is that output becomes testable, so the conversion is not done until
  something tests it.** An abstraction introduced without a capture-based test spends the cost and
  skips the benefit -- do not check this item off on the refactor alone.
  Start with `placement_probe`: its output is a published artifact that strangers paste into a
  discussion thread, so "can this be captured and asserted end to end?" has real value there rather
  than being architectural tidiness.

## M-inf -- Parked

Ungated work with no identified predecessor deliverable.

- [ ] **M-inf.1** -- Root-cause the process death when impersonating the UAC-linked token. The device-map
  probe reached a marker immediately before `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` on a token obtained via
  `TokenLinkedToken` and never the marker immediately after, with no panic message. It was removed from the
  probe because a `LOGON32_LOGON_NEW_CREDENTIALS` token answered the question with a passing control, so
  the fallback was redundant -- not because the crash was understood. Parked rather than dropped so the
  unexplained result is not mistaken for a tested one.
